A chain of ``stout smearing'' with optimized coefficients improves topoloical tunneling
in our test one dimensional system.
Parameters trained for a small system of size $N=64$
works for a larger system of size $N=256$.

Plans: (a) Try optimize the trivializing map directly, by reducing the force or the action difference.
(b) Test with 2D U(1) model.
(c) Try neural network parametrized smearing.
